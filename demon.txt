A car is a wheeled motor vehicle used for transportation. It is typically designed to carry passengers, although some cars may also be used for the transportation of goods. Cars are powered by internal combustion engines, electric motors, or a combination of both (hybrid vehicles). They come in various shapes and sizes, ranging from small compact cars to larger SUVs and trucks.

Key features of a car include a chassis or frame, an engine, wheels, tires, and a system for steering and control. Cars are a common mode of personal transportation in many parts of the world, offering individuals the flexibility and convenience to travel relatively quickly between locations.

The automotive industry produces a wide variety of car models, each with its own characteristics, features, and purposes. Cars have become integral to modern society, influencing transportation, commerce, and daily life in numerous ways.
